### About
The **Password Generator** is a simple yet highly effective tool designed to create secure and customizable passwords for a wide range of applications. With security being more important than ever, this tool enables users to generate strong, random passwords that include a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It ensures that the generated passwords are unpredictable and highly secure, making them ideal for protecting online accounts, systems, or confidential information.

### Key Features:
- **Customizable Options:** Users can set the desired length of the password and select which character types to include (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters) based on their security needs.
- **Secure Randomization:** The generator uses a strong randomization algorithm to ensure that each password is unique and difficult to guess, reducing the risk of brute-force attacks.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The tool is designed with simplicity in mind, allowing users to generate passwords quickly and easily without needing technical knowledge.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is optimized for all devices, ensuring a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile platforms.
- **Copy-to-Clipboard:** Once a password is generated, it can easily be copied to the clipboard with a single click for quick use in any application or website.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML5** for the structure and layout of the application.
- **CSS3** for creating a clean, responsive, and user-friendly design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for handling password generation logic, randomization, and user interaction.
- **Clipboard API** for providing the functionality to easily copy generated passwords.

- **Password History:** Implementing a feature that allows users to view and retrieve previously generated passwords during their session.
